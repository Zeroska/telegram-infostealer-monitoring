Require using python3, to install package that required please run the command below after clone the repo

Why we install cryptg: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64047589/why-is-telethon-so-slow-to-send-files, I amaze by this knowlege -> when install this package,
telethon decrypt data using C rather than Python -> which is much much faster
Or you can just use the FastTelethonHelper

## How to use it / Configuration

**Create .env** file and has these information, these information can generate using telegram api webpage (https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id -> show how you can get the api_hash and app_id).  

``` conf
api_hash="your_api_hash"
api_id="your_app_id"
phone_number = "your_phone_number"
download_path="path"
webhook_url='' # Add your URL Webhook right here, but use '' not ""
```
**Download path is the path that you will store the leak data you crawl from the telegram channel**

# How to find these channel or Telegram channel in general
- https://telegra.ph/Tips-how-to-find-private-hidden-personal-groups-and-channels---TelegramPrivateChatLeaks-08-10
In this post there are few thing I like about it
- About the invitation link of Telegram 
- Using google dork, and telegram dork to find channel that private

Combine with the keyword and understanding of Telegram channel URL we can craft few dork to search for these leak channel. There are some basic search queries:
- site:t.me/joinchat access
- site:t.me/joinchat logs
- site:t.me/joinchat txt 
- site:t.me/joinchat 
- intext:t.me/ 
- intext:t.me/joinchat {keyword}
- site:t.me/ {keyword}

Some keyword that might relevant: 
redline, logs, cloudlogs, logsfree, free logs, hacking software, rat, ddos, trojan, 
botnet, infect, virus, spyware, cloud extractor, bltools, pegasus, cve, dcrat, venom,
aurora, stealer, free stealer, dropper, binder, blackhat, fud, asyncrat


## How does it work 

The script will using telethon to iteract with telegram download any TXT, RAR, CSV, ZIP file in chat or channel that you have join by using the API Hash and API ID that you generated by following this document (https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/basic/signing-in.html)

Search for keyword which is your email handle, domain or anything that important to you and output to a file or any channel that you like (Telegram, Tea,s chat, Discord by using webhook)
